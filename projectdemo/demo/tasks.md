- Most Important Issues
  - The Visual and the Domain are not in sync, which causes the ball to act weird. The issue is due to the use of Thread.sleep().
    - If we cannot solve this issue properly it is going to cause a bigger headache when implementing multiplayer; Which will use multithreading.
    - It also prevents us from implementing the new spell that will change the ball speed.
- Important Issues
  - The Game and GamePanel classes are built in a confusing way, making it difficult to maintain and fix the code.
  - Main Menu crashes when switching to other panels. It also opens multiple instances of itself on some PCs.
    - We did manage to get it to work for single-player but it will likely cause issues when we add more windows.
- Missing Parts
  - Database should connect with the rest of the code.
  - The spells should work with the rest of the code.
  - Building mode should have its own GUI and should not be done on the terminal.
    - We should probably fix the main menu issues before doing this part.
  - Load Game should lead to its own screen with options.
    - Again, after main menu is fixed.
- Misc
  - Collision & Reflections have a lot of room for improvement.
  - The barriers should be placed better on the screen and have room to move.
  - Explosive & Rewarding barriers should be implemented to full function but let’s do that after we improve the threading issues.
    - Because multiple moving elements can make it worse.
  - We need assets for the new barrier type and the projectiles.
  - GUI can improve.
- Ideas
  - New Barrier Types & Spells:
    - Cursed Barrier - Puts a random malevolent spell on the player that destroys it.
    - Blinking Barrier - A barrier that appears and disappears at certain times.
    - Shuffle - A malevolent spell that switches the controls of the player (right button would move left etc).
  - Achievement System
    - Player-Progression would be more meaningful instead of just storing the high score.
    - Sample Achievements:
      - “Flawless Victory”: Clear a level without losing any lives.
      - “The Old Fashioned Way”: Win a multiplayer game without activating any spells (but your opponent does)
      - “Chain Reaction”: Have at least 4 explosive barrier projectiles on the screen at the same time.
